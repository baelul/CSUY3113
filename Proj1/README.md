# Project Aim
Create a simple 2D game. To read the original prompt, click [here](https://github.com/carmineguida/CS3113/blob/master/Projects/Project%201%20-%20Simple%202D%20Scene.pdf). 

## Project Background

For those that do not watch Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji Itadori, the pink-haired boy in my game, consumed a cursed finger and gains the powers of a very powerful curse, Ryomen Sukuna. This is why you see him gain black marks on his face after eating the finger; those are the marks of the curse.

I've attached a gif of my game below!

# Future Developments

There was one feature that didn't make it into the final game: I planned on having 3 separate textures for Itadori; before eating the finger, after eating the finger, and then turning into the curse. However, I would have needed to use some sort of delay function to allow the second texture to be shown for long enough before the third texture showed. Since we didn't learn about delays, I decided to combine the second and third textures.
