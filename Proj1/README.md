# Project 1: How Jujutsu Kaisen Came to Be

For those that do not watch Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji Itadori, the pink-haired boy in my game, consumed a cursed finger and gains the powers of a very powerful curse, Ryomen Sukuna. This is why you see him gain black marks on his face after eating the finger; those are the marks of the curse.

The greatest challenge I had was uderstanding how to add multiple objects into one game. However, once I figured that out (by adding more matrices), the rest was smooth sailing.

My favorite part of coding this project was adding the textures, because I started to see the game actually come to life. I also like the feature I added that switched textures based on a conditional.

There was one feature that didn't make it into the final game: I planned on having 3 separate textures for Itadori; before eating the finger, after eating the finger, and then turning into the curse. However, I would have needed to use some sort of delay function to allow the second texture to be shown for long enough before the third texture showed. Since we didn't learn about delays, I decided to combine the second and third textures.

I've attached a gif of my game below!
