## How to Play

Use the spacebar to start the game. This is a multiplayer game, so two people can 
play together using one computer. The righthand player uses the W and S keys to move the paddle,
and the lefthand player uses the Up and Down Arrow keys.

When the ball hits a wall (not the top or bottom), the game is over and the ball stops moving.
