## How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character (green alien). Use space bar to jump. Avoid the enemies (the pink aliens). Your goal is not to get touched by  enemies and to pass through all three levels. You don't have to, but 
you can defeat enemies by jumping on top of their heads.

You win if you can successfully make it through the three levels. You lose if lose all three lives.

## Technologies

## How to Launch
Download the repo and open in XCode. Press build (the play button in the corner) to run!

## Future Developments

If I had more time, I would have made sure the camera stopped scrolling when I reached a certain point of the level,
so that the edge of the world is not visible when the character is reaching the end.
