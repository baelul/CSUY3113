# CSUY3113 - Introduction to Game Programming

In this course, we will learn how to create simple 2D games. We will learn about vectors, coordinate systems, sprites, collisions, physics, audio and handling input. This will all be done with C++ programming and utilizing the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) libraries along with OpenGL.
