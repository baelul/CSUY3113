## How to Play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the character (green alien). Use space bar to jump. Avoid the enemies (the pink aliens). Your goal is not to get touched by any enemies and to defeat them by jumping on top of their heads.

You win if you can successfully defeat all AI without being touched. You lose if you touch any AI.
