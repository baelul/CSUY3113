# Project 6 - Top Down 2D Game - _Mood Walkers_
## Project Aim
Create a top down 2D game using the content learned throughout the semester. To read the original prompt, click [here](https://github.com/carmineguida/CS3113/blob/master/Projects/Project%206%20-%20Student's%20Choice.pdf). 

### Project Background

In the game _Moon Walkers_, the user, an astronaut, but find their way through an abandon spaceship, looking for keys in each room
and avoiding enemies lurking behind. The goal is to gain access to all three rooms and make it through the spaceship
alive. The game consists of a menu screen, three levels, AI, music, and sound effects.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the character (astronaut). Avoid the enemies (the one-eyed aliens). Your goal is not to get touched by enemies and to pass through all three levels. You cannot defeat enemies; you can only avoid them.

You win if you can successfully make it through the three levels. You lose if lose all three lives.

## Technologies
* XCode
* C++ and C
* SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) in C
* OpenGL in C++

## How to Launch
Download the repo and open in XCode. Press build (the play button in the corner) to run!

## Future Developments
I wish I could've added an attack feature to the game, for both the character and the enemies. I wanted to implement some
sort of shooting or slashing element to the character, so that the user could also defeat enemies instead of helplessly avoiding them, adding a little more excitement to the game. Same goes for enemy attacks, which the player would have to 
evade.
